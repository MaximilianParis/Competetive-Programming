# Competetive-Programming
Solutions, testing scripts

Dear Reader,

this repository is the collection of my solutions for difficult Problems in C/C++ and contains my testing tools.
The solution files will often have a link to the problem statement and constraints at the top, if not just google the filename.
Sometimes there will also be a brute force solution and random test data generator.
I hope you find these files helpful.

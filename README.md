# Competetive-Programming
Solutions, testing scripts

Dear Reader,

this repository is the collection of my solutions for difficult Problems in C/C++ and contains my testing tools.
The solution files will often have a link to the problem statement and constraints at the top, if not you could decrypt
the filename. I have the following general pattern for my file names:
Platform Name-Round-Problem Name-(Problem Tags), you could try to google these.
Sometimes there will also be a brute force solution and a random test data generator.
I hope you find these files helpful.
